## 🗂️ Task Board with Local Storage Persistence

## 📖 Project Description

The Task Board with Local Storage Persistence is a lightweight task management system designed to organize tasks into three categories: To Do, Doing, and Done. Tasks are saved in Local Storage, ensuring that your data remains intact even after refreshing the page or reopening the browser.

The application features a responsive design, an intuitive modal for creating tasks, and dynamic rendering of tasks directly onto the board. It is modular, easy to maintain, and provides a smooth user experience across desktop and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – Structure of the application

CSS3 – Styling and responsive layout

JavaScript (ES6+) – Dynamic rendering, modular logic, and local storage persistence

Local Storage API – Data persistence between sessions

Figma Design Reference – Ensuring UI/UX consistency

## ✨ Features
